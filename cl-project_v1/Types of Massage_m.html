                        <p> Deep Tissue massage is designed to relieve severe tension in the muscle and the
                            connective tissue or fascia. This type of massage focuses on the muscles located below
                            the surface of the top muscles. Deep tissue massage is often recommended for individuals
                            who experience consistent pain, are involved in heavy physical activity, such as
                            athletes, and patients who have sustained physical injury. It is also not uncommon for
                            receivers of deep tissue massage to have their pain replaced with a new muscle ache for
                            a day or two. Deep tissue work varies greatly. What one calls deep tissue another will
                            call light. When receiving deep tissue work it is important to communicate what you are
                            feeling.</span></p>

                        <p> Myofascial release is a form of soft tissue therapy used to treat somatic
                            dysfunction and accompanying pain and restriction of motion. This is accomplished by
                            relaxing contracted muscles, increasing circulation, increasing venous and lymphatic
                            drainage, and stimulating the stretch reflex of muscles and overlying fascia.</span></p>

                        <p> Prenatal massage is similar to massage during non-pregnancy in terms of the goals
                            (relaxation, pain relief, increased circulation & mobility, etc.). However, due to the
                            changes undergone during pregnancy, modification are made. To accommodate swollen tender
                            breasts and a growing belly, special pillows, positioning and techniques are utilized to
                            ensure comfort for both the expecting mother and baby. With increasing weight, a
                            changing center of gravity and the many other changes associated with pregnancy,
                            prenatal massage can help provide relief and a sense of well being that is much
                            deserved.</span></p>

                            <p> Sports massage is actually a form of Swedish massage that is delivered to athletes. Most
                                commonly, sports massage focuses on increasing blood and lymphatic fluid flow, reducing
                                and eliminating pain as well as tender trigger points, and increasing range of motion of
                                the affected area. Sports massages can be broken into four distinct types - the
                                pre-event sports massage, the post-event sports massage, the restorative sports massage
                                and the rehabilitative sports massage. As the names indicate, each type of sports
                                massage has a different focus for the athlete as they are delivered at different times
                                during their training and performance schedule.</span></p>

                        <p> Swedish massage uses five styles of long, flowing strokes to massage. The five basic
                            strokes are effleurage (sliding or gliding), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic
                            tapping), friction (cross fiber) and vibration/shaking. Swedish massage has shown to be
                            helpful in reducing pain, joint stiffness, and improving function in patients with
                            osteoarthritis of the knee over a period of eight weeks. It has also been shown to be
                            helpful in individuals with poor circulation. The development of Swedish massage is
                            credited to Per Henrik Ling, though the Dutch practitioner Johan Georg Mezger adopted
                            the French names to denote the basic strokes. The term "Swedish" massage is not really
                            known in the country of Sweden, where it is called "classic massage".</span></p>

                        <p> Trigger points or trigger sites are described as hyperirritable spots in skeletal muscle
                            that are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. Trigger point
                            practitioners believe that palpable nodules are small contraction knots [ambiguous] and
                            a common cause of pain. Compression of a trigger point may elicit local tenderness,
                            referred pain, or local twitch response. The local twitch response is not the same as a
                            muscle spasm. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle entirely
                            contracting whereas the local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only
                            involves a small twitch, no contraction. The trigger point model states that unexplained
                            pain frequently radiates from these points of local tenderness to broader areas,
                            sometimes distant from the trigger point itself. Practitioners claim to have identified
                            reliable referred pain patterns, allowing practitioners to associate pain in one
                            location with trigger points elsewhere.</span>

                        <p> Cupping Therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which the therapist puts
                            special cups on the skin to create suction. This is used for many purposes, including to
                            help with pain, inflammatio, blood flow, promote healing and relaxation. The suction and
                            negative pressure provided by Cupping can loosen muscles, encourage blood flow, releases
                            toxins, breaks up fascia and sedates the nervous system.</span></p>
