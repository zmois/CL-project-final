            <p>There are a variety of different styles, types and techniques of massage
                utilized by massage therapists. I provided a description of some of the more popular and well known
                types of massage being used today.</p>

               <h3> Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
                <p> Deep Tissue massage is designed to relieve severe tension in the muscle and the connective tissue or
                    fascia. This type of massage <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                        focuses on the muscles located below the surface of the top muscles. Deep tissue massage is
                        often recommended for individuals who experience consistent pain, are involved in heavy physical
                        activity, such as athletes, and patients who have sustained physical injury. It is also not
                        uncommon for receivers of Deep Tissue Massage to have their pain replaced with a new muscle ache
                        for a day or two. Deep tissue work varies greatly. What one calls deep tissue another will call
                        light. When receiving deep tissue work it is important to communicate what you are
                        feeling.</span></p>

               <h3> Myofascial Release</h3>
                <p> Myofascial release is a form of soft tissue therapy used to treat somatic
                    dysfunction and accompanying pain and restriction <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    of motion. This is accomplished by relaxing contracted muscles, increasing circulation, increasing
                    venous and lymphatic drainage, and stimulating the stretch reflex of muscles and overlying
                    fascia.</span></p>

            <h3>Prenatal Massage</h3>
            <p> Prenatal massage is similar to massage during non-pregnancy in terms of the goals
                (relaxation, pain relief, increased circulation <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    & mobility, etc.). However, due to the changes undergone during pregnancy, modification are made. To
                    accommodate swollen tender breasts and a growing belly, special pillows, positioning and
                    techniques are utilized to ensure comfort for both the expecting mother and baby.
                    With increasing weight, a changing center of gravity and the many other changes
                    associated with pregnancy, prenatal massage can help provide relief and a sense of
                    well being that is much deserved.</span></p>

            <h3>Sports Massage</h3>
            <p> Sports massage is actually a form of Swedish massage that is delivered to athletes. Most
                commonly, sports massage focuses on increasing <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    blood and lymphatic fluid flow, reducing and eliminating pain as well as tender trigger points, and
                    increasing range of motion of the affected area. Sports massages can be broken into four distinct
                    types
                    - the pre-event sports massage, the post-event sports massage, the restorative sports massage and
                    the rehabilitative sports massage. As the names indicate, each type of sports massage has a
                    different focus for the athlete as they are delivered at different times during their
                    training and performance schedule.</span></p>

            <h3>Swedish Massage</h3>
            <p> Swedish massage uses five styles of long, flowing strokes to massage. The five basic
                strokes are effleurage (sliding or gliding), petrissage <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction (cross fiber) and vibration/shaking. Swedish
                    massage has shown to be helpful in reducing pain, joint stiffness, and improving function in
                    patients with osteoarthritis of the knee over a period of eight weeks. It has also been shown to be
                    helpful in individuals with poor circulation. The development of Swedish massage is credited
                    to Per Henrik Ling, though the Dutch practitioner Johan Georg Mezger adopted the French
                    names to denote the basic strokes. The term "Swedish" massage is not really known in the
                    country of Sweden, where it is called "classic massage".</span></p>

            <div>
            <h3>Trigger Point Therapy</h3>
            <p> Trigger points or trigger sites are described as hyperirritable spots in skeletal muscle
                that are associated with palpable nodules <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    in taut bands of muscle fibers. Trigger point practitioners believe that palpable nodules are small
                    contraction knots [ambiguous] and a common cause of pain. Compression of a trigger point may elicit
                    local tenderness, referred pain, or local twitch response. The local twitch response is not the same
                    as a muscle spasm. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle entirely contracting
                    whereas the local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only involves a small twitch,
                    no contraction. The trigger point model states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from
                    these points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant from the trigger point
                    itself. Practitioners claim to have identified reliable referred pain patterns, allowing
                    practitioners to associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere.</span></p>

            <h3>Cupping Therapy</h3>
            <p> Cupping Therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which the therapist puts
                special cups on the skin to create suction. This is used for <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammatio, blood flow, promote healing and relaxatio.
                    The suction and negative pressure provided by Cupping can loosen muscles, encourage blood flow,
                    releases toxins, breaks up fascia and sedates the nervous system.</span></p>
