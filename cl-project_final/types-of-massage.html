                Deep Tissue Massage is designed to relieve severe tension in the
                muscle and the connective tissue or fascia. This type of massage
                focuses on the muscles located below the surface of the top
                muscles. Deep tissue massage is often recommended for
                individuals who experience consistent pain, are involved in
                heavy physical activity, such as athletes, and patients who have
                sustained physical injury. It is also not uncommon for receivers
                of deep tissue massage to have their pain replaced with a new
                muscle ache for a day or two. Deep tissue work varies greatly.
                What one calls deep tissue another will call light. When
                receiving deep tissue work it is important to communicate what
                you are feeling.

                Myofascial Release is a form of soft tissue therapy used to
                treat somatic dysfunction and accompanying pain and restriction
                of motion. This is accomplished by relaxing contracted muscles,
                increasing circulation, increasing venous and lymphatic
                drainage, and stimulating the stretch reflex of muscles and
                overlying fascia.

                Prenatal Massage is similar to massage during non-pregnancy in
                terms of the goals (relaxation, pain relief, increased
                circulation & mobility, etc.). However, due to the changes
                undergone during pregnancy, modification are made. To
                accommodate swollen tender breasts and a growing belly, special
                pillows, positioning and techniques are utilized to ensure
                comfort for both the expecting mother and baby. With increasing
                weight, a changing center of gravity and the many other changes
                associated with pregnancy, prenatal massage can help provide
                relief and a sense of well being that is much deserved.

                Sports Massage is actually a form of Swedish massage that is
                delivered to athletes. Most commonly, sports massage focuses on
                increasing blood and lymphatic fluid flow, reducing and
                eliminating pain as well as tender trigger points, and
                increasing range of motion of the affected area. Sports massages
                can be broken into four distinct types - the pre-event sports
                massage, the post-event sports massage, the restorative sports
                massage and the rehabilitative sports massage. As the names
                indicate, each type of sports massage has a different focus for
                the athlete as they are delivered at different times during
                their training and performance schedule.

                Swedish Massage uses five styles of long, flowing strokes to
                massage. The five basic strokes are effleurage (sliding or
                gliding), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping),
                friction (cross fiber) and vibration/shaking. Swedish massage
                has shown to be helpful in reducing pain, joint stiffness, and
                improving function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee
                over a period of eight weeks. It has also been shown to be
                helpful in individuals with poor circulation. The development of
                Swedish massage is credited to Per Henrik Ling, though the Dutch
                practitioner Johan Georg Mezger adopted the French names to
                denote the basic strokes. The term "Swedish" massage is not
                really known in the country of Sweden, where it is called
                "classic massage".

                Trigger Points are described as hyperirritable spots in skeletal
                muscle that are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands
                of muscle fibers. Trigger point practitioners believe that
                palpable nodules are small contraction knots and a common cause
                of pain. Compression of a trigger point may elicit local
                tenderness, referred pain, or local twitch response. The local
                twitch response is not the same as a muscle spasm. Muscle spasm
                refers to the entire muscle entirely contracting whereas the
                local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only
                involves a small twitch, no contraction. The trigger point model
                states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from these
                points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant
                from the trigger point itself. Practitioners claim to have
                identified reliable referred pain patterns, which allows to
                associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere.

                Cupping Therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in
                which the therapist puts special cups on the skin to create
                suction. This is used for many purposes, including to help with
                pain, inflammatio, blood flow, promote healing and relaxation.
                The suction and negative pressure provided by cupping can loosen
                muscles, encourage blood flow, releases toxins, breaks up fascia
                and sedates the nervous system.
